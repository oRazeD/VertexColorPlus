	- Apply outliner VColor to selected geometry
	- Set outliner VColor as Active Color
	- Select all geometry that use the corresponding outliner vertex color
	- Delete outliner VColor from entire object
	- Convert outliner VColor to VGroup for manipulation with things like modifiers
	- HSV/RGB values preview switch
- Many alternative methods of applying vertex color

# TODO / Future Update Paths
- [ ] Multiple vertex color to vertex group methods
	- [x] Vertex color to single vertex group
	- [ ] Vertex color to R G B A separated vertex groups
	- [ ] Batch options for either listed above
- [ ] Convert vertex group to vertex color
- [ ] Import/export palette presets to/from a custom format


# Support

Vertex Colors Plus is a FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) project, which means I see very little return on my time spent developing and maintaining it.

If you would like to support me, consider sending me a tip on [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/razed)!
